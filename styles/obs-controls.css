/**
 * OBS Controls Stylesheet
 * 
 * This file defines the .obs-control class for controls that should:
 * - Stay at 0% opacity (completely invisible) during normal operation
 * - Fade to 100% opacity ONLY when the cursor is directly on top of them
 * 
 * This ensures a perfectly clean look in OBS while still allowing control via "Interact".
