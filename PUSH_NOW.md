## ⚙️ Don't Forget!

In GitHub Settings → Pages, make sure to change:

**Source:** ~~"Deploy from a branch"~~ → **"GitHub Actions"** ⚙️

2. **Click:** "Get Token from Twitch"
3. **Copy & paste** your token
4. **Add overlays to OBS** with the URLs above

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

Check the Actions tab for error details. Most common issues:
- Source not set to "GitHub Actions" in Settings
- Build errors (but we already tested and it works!)
- Permissions (workflow has all needed permissions)
